# Kernel DeFi Guild project

> Forked from the excellent [eth-scaffold](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) project.

This project serves as starting point for DeFi Guild participants (and non-participants) to start building a DeFi project. It includes a contract (Bondable) and a React frontend.

The [DeFi Guild](https://www.kernel.community/en/build/defi) will conduct Juntos and Convos around the project. Feel free to send DMs on Slack or simply open a Github issue here!
